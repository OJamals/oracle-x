## üí° Integration Recommendations

### 1. Hybrid Integration Strategy (Recommended)

**Implementation Approach**:
- Add GNews as a **supplementary high-quality source**
- Maintain current sources for speed and social sentiment
- Use GNews for symbol-specific financial news enhancement
- Implement intelligent source weighting based on content type

**Configuration**:
```python
# Enhanced DataFeedOrchestrator configuration
GNEWS_INTEGRATION = {
    'enabled': True,
    'weight': 0.3,  # 30% weight for GNews content
    'use_for_symbols': True,  # Symbol-specific searches
    'use_topics': ['BUSINESS', 'FINANCE'],  # Relevant topics
    'cache_ttl': 1800,  # 30-minute cache for GNews content
    'fallback_enabled': True  # Graceful degradation
}
```

### 2. Selective Enhancement Approach

**Use Cases for GNews**:
- **Earnings Periods**: Higher GNews weight during earnings seasons
- **Breaking News**: Supplement breaking news with professional coverage
- **Symbol Analysis**: Enhanced fundamental analysis with quality journalism
- **Market Events**: Professional coverage of market-moving events

### 3. Quality-Weighted Aggregation

**Scoring System**:
- **Current Sources**: Speed bonus (0.9-1.0x) + social sentiment value
- **GNews Sources**: Quality bonus (1.1-1.3x) + relevance scoring
- **Dynamic Weighting**: Adjust based on symbol, market conditions, and user preferences
