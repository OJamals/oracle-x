"""Regression test: Ensure FinViz news sentiment path no longer triggers
ValueError: The truth value of a DataFrame is ambiguous.

The previous implementation used chained boolean / `or` expressions that could
implicitly evaluate a pandas DataFrame in a truthy context, raising the
ambiguous truth-value error. This test exercises the FinViz news sentiment
adapter (if available) and fails if such an exception resurfaces.

Network / scraping environments can vary; if the adapter is unavailable or
no news is returned, the test will pass as long as no ambiguous ValueError
occurs. Any occurrence of the specific ValueError message is a failure.
