    description: Analyzed existing data feeds directory and user requirements
    outcome: Identified architectural issues and created comprehensive development blueprint
    findings:
      - Three parallel consolidated feed systems need consolidation
      - Many critical feeds (dark pools, options flow, earnings) are placeholder implementations
      - User needs directional accuracy for options leverage trading, not complex options strategies
      - Self-learning capability is crucial for improving prediction accuracy over time
    issues:
      - Current system has significant data quality risks due to placeholder feeds
      - No systematic approach to validating prediction accuracy
      - Missing options-specific data analysis for timing precision
