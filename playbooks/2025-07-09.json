  "tomorrows_tape": "Markets remain buoyed by broad participation and constructive sentiment, with leading tech names continuing to see accumulation and bullish momentum into earnings. NFLX stands out for possible breakout as strong options and dark pool flows underpin high conviction buying. MSFT shows robust institutional activity, suggesting further upside is likely unless a market-wide pullback materializes. TSLA, in contrast, faces potential near-term headwinds as defensive flows and hedging increase despite positive crowd chatter. Watch for any shifts in breadth or volatility that might foreshadow a sudden sector rotation or reversal."
